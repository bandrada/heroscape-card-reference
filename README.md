Created the day of the Age of Annihilation preorder announcement, this simple list of links allows you to view the official Renegade Heroscape Cards and lore articles on the newly released age of annihilation characters. 
The official site currently has a disastrous user experience when trying to navigate to this useful information. 
It was created out of frustration of an excited player who knew there must be a better way. From [this page]() you are able to view a list of all the pages you may want to visit about character card information on Renegade's Heroscape site.
And, you can jump from one page to the next with ease! Who knew web development could be so difficult..

I hope to make more useful tools around viewing character information for new, old, and custom figures. This page is a temporary fix for the terrible UX renegade has given us.

May this save you time and headheache
